It's a tough road for anyone, but your story has particular poignance. You may or may not have a legal obligation to care for your parent, and that may be something worth looking into, if for no other reason than knowing whether or not you \"have to\" do what you're doing.  Other people will have great advice and insight; I just want to make sure you get a response promptly. If you are able to get legal power of attorney and healthcare power of attorney those may be worthwhile, but only after you have discussed the situation, including prospects of keeping your mother where she is or moving her to your area and the legal ramifications of each. Alzheimer's is a stupendously expensive disease, with little support.\n",

You'll have time to call 211 and find out what resources are available for her and you. Call the 1- 800 number for the Alzheimer's hotline and see what they can offer you. And get her a doctor right away and they may be able to suggest programs as well.   It is very daunting to care for a parent with Alz but the decline is usually slow and you'll learn as you go and most people rise to the occasion and do a good job.
